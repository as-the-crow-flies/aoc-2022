This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)!

For each day:
- solutions are a ```src/<day>.rs```
- input files are in ```input/<day>.txt```

To run the solution for a particular day, call the following:

```bash
cargo run --bin <day>
```
